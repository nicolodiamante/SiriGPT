The advanced technologies propelling the latest generation of chatbots have been gaining momentum over the years, revolutionising our world. With the launch of ChatGPT, a competitive scramble amongst the brightest minds has begun in Silicon Valley, each looking to break new ground in what chatbots can do. Despite the existence of voice assistants like [Siri][apple-siri], they don't quite measure up to the capabilities of ChatGPT. By merging the best aspects of both, we can significantly enhance Siri's intelligence and elevate the potential of chatbots. Incorporating ChatGPT into Siri offers an unparalleled way to interact with and enhance our devices. This integration offers users access to three powerful features within Siri: [ChatGPT][chaGPT]'s impressive intelligence, [DALL·E][dalle]'s innovative creativity, and [Whisper][whisper]'s precise transformation of audio into text. This combination of capabilities promises an exceptionally advanced chatbot experience.

Integrating ChatGPT with Siri is fairly straightforward. However, it requires certain specific prerequisites and links for seamless functioning.
<br><br>

## Requirements to get ChatGPT to work with Siri

### Get the Shortcut

To initiate, first download the [Apple Shortcuts][apple-shortcuts-download] app followed by the [Chatty shortcut][sirigpt-shortcut]. Feel free to rename the shortcut to a title of your preference. However, before you begin using it, ensure that you continue reading for further instructions.

</p>

<br><br>

### Create your OpenAI API Key

To utilise ChatGPT's services with Siri, it is essential to obtain an OpenAI API key. In order to acquire this key, you need to generate a new secret key from your existing OpenAI account. If you don't possess an OpenAI account yet, you can easily create one by following this [link][openai-signup]. This secret key plays a crucial role in verifying your authentication. Here are the steps on how to do it:

1. Log in to your [OpenAI account][openai-account].
2. Search for the "Create new secret key" option and click on it.

  </picture>
</p>

Once you obtain the [API Key][openai-API], incorporating ChatGPT's services with Siri is straightforward. It's important to remember, after making a copy of the key and closing the pop-up, you won't have access to it again. Therefore, store the key securely in a safe location.
<br><br>

## How to set up and use ChatGPT with Siri

### Setting Up

After downloading the shortcut and copying your API key, follow these steps to put it to use:

- Begin by opening the Shortcuts app and finding the downloaded Chatty shortcut.

- Upon activating the "Chatty" shortcut, you'll need to enter your OpenAI API key. You can choose to store this key either directly in the shortcut or in the Data Jar app. However, if you choose to store the key in the shortcut, it's crucial to ensure their privacy. Any inadvertent exposure could compromise your security and potentially result in a breach.

- Next, continue with the configuration procedure. Follow each essential step attentively to customise the outcome prompt based on your specific preferences for the shortcut. Once finished, you can start using 'Chatty' right away.

<br>

### Considerations

ChatGPT is one of the foremost chatbots available today, with the capability to generate responses remarkably similar to human interaction. However, like all technology, it does present certain limitations and necessitates particular usage patterns to deliver the expected results. If you've found SiriGPT less useful, it might be due to the lack of specificity in your input. For SiriGPT (aka chatGPT) to provide precise and accurate responses, it's critical to clearly define your desired results. General or vague instructions will most likely result in a similarly unfocused answer, while an explicit and well-defined request will generate a more purposeful and useful response.

In summary, to exploit SiriGPT to its fullest, it is imperative to detail what you want and provide clear directives on what to avoid. Keeping these guidelines in mind, you can harness the full power of this advanced chatbot and simplify your daily tasks.

<br><br>

ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Whisper represent three highly notable breakthroughs in AI technology in recent years. The potential of SiriGPT lies in combining their capabilities into a single solution, revolutionising how we interact with our devices, and thus significantly simplifying our lives. However, just like with any technological advancement, there are inherent limitations. There may be instances where they fail to produce the anticipated results due to external factors such as server overload or inadequate data. In conclusion, while such technologies undoubtedly simplify our tasks, it is crucial to always consider the input, be mindful of potential limitations, and remember to handle the output with care.

## What's new in SiriGPT

### v1.4.2

Release Highlights:

- Introduced the ability for users to customise the number of tokens used. It is important to note that the maximum number of tokens allowed for content generation is shared between the prompting and completion sections. However, the actual limit depends on the model used. On average, each token represents about 4 characters in standard English.

<br>

### v1.4.1

Release Highlights:

- Language support for Polski and Türkçe is now available, providing a more inclusive experience for users.

- The Speech Recognition (ASR) functionality has been significantly enhanced with the introduction of the Whisper translation feature. This allows for transcriptions of audio files from any supported language into English text. Please note, translation is currently limited to English.

  With Chatty, you can easily use voice translation to convert audio messages into text in various languages. To get started, all you need to do is type or say the command "Translate" in any of the supported languages. Supported languages include Arabic "ترجمة", Catalan "Tradueix", German "Übersetzen", Spanish "Traducir", Francès Canadenc "Traduire", French "Traduire", Hindi "अनुवाद करना", Italian "Traduci", Japanese "翻訳", Korean "번역하기", Polish "Przetłumacz", Portuguese "Traduzir", Russian "Перевести", Turkish "Çevir", Chinese "翻译", and Cantonese "翻譯". To stop the recording, simply tap the screen. Upon completion, Chatty will automatically translate and transcribe the recorded text for you. This functionality serves as a convenient solution for users who need to convert lengthy audio messages into text, making communication in languages other than English hassle-free.

  Following the same steps as the transcription will also allow for translation from the received text into a different language (check the steps in version 1.4 below).

<br>

### v1.4

Release Highlights:

<br>

## SiriGPT Privacy

Users have the right to privacy, which is why SiriGPT lets you decide which personal data you wish to share during its setup. SiriGPT is a feature within the Apple ecosystem that offers built-in protection, including situations where third-party service providers work in coordination with Apple. However, SiriGPT's functionality depends on the OpenAI API. Hence, if you are reluctant about sharing information with a third-party service, you will not be able to utilise SiriGPT. Should you decide to experiment with SiriGPT, we strongly encourage you to review the Privacy Policies of [OpenAI][openai-privacy] beforehand.

## Notes

### GPT-4

This shortcut is primarily programmed to operate on the GPT-4 model by default. When we compare the operations of GPT-4 model with the GPT-3.5 model, there is little to distinguish between them in terms of performance for relatively straightforward tasks. However, the GPT-4 model outperforms the previous versions, especially when encountering complex reasoning scenarios. If you wish to access the GPT-4-serviced API, it's crucial to note that this privilege is limited to APIs with a history of successful transactions. If an API isn't eligible to run on the GPT-4 model, for instance, if it doesn't meet ChatGPT-4's qualification criteria, it's recommended to default to the GPT-3.5-Turbo model. If you're looking to explore the various subscription packages, you can review the available options [here][openai-prices].

<br>

### DAN Mode

Just as humans have a dark side, so does AI. The Do Anything Now (DAN) Mode empowers SiriGPT to perform actions beyond its typical AI guidelines, potentially leading to breaches of OpenAI standards, with issues of inaccuracy and offensiveness arising. **Consequently, it's advised to use DAN in a thoughtful and responsible manner.**

<br>

### Whisper

The Whisper API has a default file size limit of 25 MB. If your audio file exceeds this limit, you have two options: either break it into chunks of 25 MB or less, or use a compressed audio format. To ensure optimal performance, it is advisable to avoid dividing the audio in the middle of a sentence, as it may lead to the loss of contextual information.

Here are the languages currently supported through both the transcription and translation endpoints: Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Marathi, Maori, Nepali, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, and Welsh.

<br>

### Siri

If you come across Siri stating "having trouble connecting to the network" or asking to "try again in a little while", the problem might be due to an unstable Wi-Fi or cellular signal. As Siri does not have an offline mode and operates by sending data to Apple servers, any issue between your device and the server may disrupt Siri's functionality. Also, if the OpenAI servers, which support SiriGPT (also known as Siri), are overwhelmed, it could potentially compromise Siri's ability to provide lengthy responses.

Try these steps to troubleshoot the issue:

- Restart your iPhone
- Check that "Listen for Hey Siri" is enabled
- Reset Siri to recognise your voice
- Check the microphone functions correctly

If after these steps the problem persists, another solution is deleting Siri & Dictionary History from the Settings menu. Go to Settings <img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/SiriGPT/assets/48920263/6256c23b-689b-4ee9-8986-f8399fde573f" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow" width="5.4px" /> Siri & Search <img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/SiriGPT/assets/48920263/6256c23b-689b-4ee9-8986-f8399fde573f" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow" width="5.4px" /> Siri & Dictionary History <img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/SiriGPT/assets/48920263/6256c23b-689b-4ee9-8986-f8399fde573f" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow" width="5.4px" /> Delete Siri & Dictionary History.

#### Language & Region

SiriGPT prompt now offers support for 18 languages, including Catalan, English (US, UK, India), Deutsch, Español, Francès Canadenc, Français, हिन्दी, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Português, Русский, اكتب, 中文, and 粤语.

The method of configuring the decimal number settings is determined by the region settings of your device. For instance, a decimal number might be set as "0.1" or "0,1."
