The technologies driving the new wave of chatbots have been brewing for years, taking the world by storm. The release of ChatGPT has triggered a Silicon Valley arms race, pitting the best minds against each other to push the limits of what chatbots can do. But while voice assistants like [Siri][apple-siri] have been around for a while, they don't pack the same punch as [ChatGPT][chaGPT]. That's where the real magic happens, by combining the best of both worlds, we can give Siri a significant IQ boost and take chatbots to new heights. The integration of ChatGPT into Siri represents a new unique way to interact and boost our devices. This shortcut allows you to access the immense intelligence of ChatGPT and the creativity of [DALL·E][dalle] within Siri, giving you a chatbot experience like never before.

Combining ChatGPT with Siri is relatively straightforward, but it does require a few specific requirements and links to ensure everything works smoothly.
<br/><br/>

## Requirements to get ChatGPT to work with Siri

### Get the Shortcut

To get started, all you need is the [Apple Shortcuts app][apple-shortcuts-download]. Once you have [downloaded the shortcut][sirigpt-shortcut], look for the "Chatty" button. You can even customise the shortcut name to suit your preferences. However, once downloaded don't run it yet, keep reading.
<br/><br/>

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/694c2e45a68f4839a8ae8c0058959d69"><img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/SiriGPT/assets/48920263/827ea7bf-1db8-4d65-a877-d2a7e60e8327" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Download theShortcut" title="Download Shortcut" width="600px" /></a></p><br/>

### Create your OpenAI API Key

To use ChatGPT's services with Siri, you'll first need to obtain the API key. This can be done by generating a new secret key from your OpenAI account, which will be required for authentication. To get started, you can obtain the key by following these steps. First, log in to your [OpenAI account][open-ai-account]. Next, look for the "Create new secret key" option and click on it.

<p align="center"><a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/SiriGPT/assets/48920263/7763c24a-4e19-4ac4-913d-da1f7eb29ee9" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="IMG show how to create new secret key" title="Create new secret key" width="750px" /></a></p>

Once you have the [API Key][open-ai-API], integrating ChatGPT's services with Siri is a breeze. It's important to note that once you copy the key and close the pop-up, you won't be able to view it again, so it's crucial to keep the key in a safe and secure location.
<br/><br/>

<p align="center"><a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/SiriGPT/assets/48920263/62ca5fce-40fd-4057-9759-d011aba93ca0" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="IMG show an example of a OpenAI API Key" title="OpenAI API Key" width="750px" /></a></p><br/>

## How to set up and use ChatGPT with Siri

### Setting Up

Once you have downloaded the shortcut and copied the API key, it’s time to make it work and see it in action:

- Open the Shortcuts app and access the downloaded Chatty shortcut.

- Once you launch the Chatty shortcut, you will be prompted to set your API key. You have two options for storing your API key: within the shortcut or inside Data Jar. To clarify, if you choose "Yes" your OpenAI API key will be stored in Data Jar, which is a third-party app for storing data in iOS. If you select "No" your API key will be kept within the Siri shortcut. It's important to note that if you choose to keep your API key in the shortcut, you should take extra care to keep your shortcut secure and not share it with anyone, as this could potentially expose your API key.

- The OpenAI API is powered by a range of models that have different capabilities and pricing plans to suit various use cases. These models include GPT-3, GPT-4. The default model used by SiriGPT is GPT-3.5-turbo. However, users are free to choose the model version they want to use based on their specific needs and requirements. Keep in mind GPT-4 is currently in a limited beta and only accessible to those who have been granted access.
<br/><br/>

<p align="center"><a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/SiriGPT/assets/48920263/cd0942d0-b2ba-48bd-a908-757b4a785c68" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="IMG show where paste your OpenAI API key" title="Paste your OpenAI API key here" width="600px" /></a></p><br/><br/>

All done! Once the integration is complete, you can launch the shortcut by tapping it within the app or from the menu bar on your Mac. Alternatively, when ready to use the shortcut, simply activate Siri and say "Chatty" followed by your question or prompt. The shortcut will then generate a response and read it back to you.
<br/><br/><br/>

### Considerations

ChatGPT is one of the most advanced chatbots available today, with the ability to generate human-like responses to a wide range of questions and inputs. However, like any technology, it has limitations and requires specific usage patterns to produce the desired output. If you have not found SiriGPT useful, it may be because you are not providing it with specific enough input. The key to obtaining precise and accurate responses from SiriGPT is to be as specific as possible about the desired output. A vague input will likely produce a vague answer, while a well-defined input will yield a more targeted and useful response.

In summary, to make the most of SiriGPT, it is essential to be specific about the desired output and provide clear instructions on what to avoid. With these guidelines in mind, you can unlock the full potential of this powerful chatbot and streamline your daily tasks.

<br/>

[ChatGPT][chaGPT] and [DALL·E][dalle] are two of the most powerful AI tools developed in recent years. They have the potential to revolutionise the way we interact with our devices and make our lives easier. However, it's important to remember that they have their limitations, and may not always be able to deliver the desired output due to external factors such as server overload or lack of data. In conclusion, SiriGPT is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionise the way we interact with our devices. By being clear and specific in our requests, we can help these tools deliver more accurate and relevant responses.

## SiriGPT Privacy

Privacy is a user's right, which is why SiriGPT allows you to choose what personal data to share during setup. SiriGPT is a shortcut within the Apple ecosystem that already provides protection, including when third-party service providers are acting on behalf of Apple. However, OpenAI API is required for SiriGPT to function. If you don't want to share information with a third-party service, you won't be able to use SiriGPT. If you choose to give SiriGPT a try, make sure to read through [OpenAI][openai-privacy]'s Privacy Policies beforehand.

## Notes

#### GPT4

Currently, to use GPT-4, you need to [join a waitlist][gpt-4-wailist]. Once you have joined it, you will receive a confirmation email. After that, you will have to wait for an invitation to use the GPT-4 API. If you qualify to use it, you will see the GPT-4 model option for testing in the playground backend. Otherwise, if you do not have the qualifications, you should choose to use the GPT-3.5-Turbo model instead.

#### DAN prompt

Like humans, AI has a dark side. The Do Anything Now (DAN) Mode enables SiriGPT to act in ways outside the usual AI rules and regulations, resulting in content that may not comply with OpenAI guidelines bringing up inaccuracy and offensiveness. **Therefore, it is recommended to use DAN wisely and responsibly.**

#### Siri

If you encounter an issue with Siri where it states it is "having trouble connecting to the network" or "try again in a little while", the cause may be an unreliable Wi-Fi or cellular signal. Currently, offline mode is not available for Siri—it works by sending data to Apple’s servers. Try these steps to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Restart your iPhone
2. Check that "Listen for Hey Siri" is enabled
3. Reset Siri to recognise your voice
4. Check the microphone functions correctly

SiriGPT may have trouble providing a long response due to overloads on the OpenAI servers or an error between your device and the Apple server. To fix it, go to Settings <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/SiriGPT/assets/48920263/6256c23b-689b-4ee9-8986-f8399fde573f" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow" width="5.4px" /></a> Siri & Search <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/SiriGPT/assets/48920263/6256c23b-689b-4ee9-8986-f8399fde573f" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow" width="5.4px" /></a> Siri & Dictionary History <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/SiriGPT/assets/48920263/6256c23b-689b-4ee9-8986-f8399fde573f" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow" width="5.4px" /></a> Delete Siri & Dictionary History.
